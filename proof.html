</style><script role="script" id="twine-user-script" type="text/twine-javascript"></script><tw-passagedata pid="1" name="Cottage" tags="" position="499,51" size="100,100">You are in a small cottage resting on the edge of an inland sea. It is dusk.

You can hear the small waves lapping at the shore. Lanterns hang from the roof and sway gently with the breeze.

Your friend Willem sits on an old flaying armchair. Family photos spanning across generations fill the wall behind him.

"I'll start organising the logistics behind everything, and act as a middleman between the villagers and Ripple and Co," he explains to you. You are starting to grow tired of Willem and his ambition. 

"All you have to do is convince the top dogs that they benefit from the transaction. We can discuss that later, though."

For weeks he has plotted to transfer ownership of Pearls that Ripple and Co, a rich fishing company, extracted from the sea to the village. The Pearls come from clams the village holds sacred. It has been a source of great hurt for the village for some time now.

"So, are you in?" he presses.

[["Ok, fine. I'm in."]]
[["But what's in it for me?"]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="&quot;Ok, fine. I&#39;m in.&quot;" tags="" position="397,199" size="100,100">"Yes! I knew you wouldn't back out Fran," Willem says. He gets off his seat and wanders over to the window, unable to keep still. "The village will be so thrilled if we pull this off, you know. We'll all add a bunch of Pearls to our bracelets." He nods at your arm.

A bracelet made of small red pearls wraps around your wrist. You wonder how they work, how they accelerate your healing and leave you without a single scar on your body. Their magic is an ancient mystery no one has ever managed to decipher.

"They won't be happy about the amount of clams being killed," you tell him. You hate to burst his bubble, but the elders at the temple with cringe at the thought of how many clams died at the mercy of the organisation.

Willem hardly looked troubled. "The sad truth is they're dead no matter what we do. The most we can do is return the Pearls back to those who hold them dear."

Thinking about the Pearls' value makes you nervous.

[["I'm going to regret this."]]
[["Okay, but I'm doing this for the village."-&gt;"I'm doing this for the village."]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="&quot;But what&#39;s in it for me?&quot;" tags="" position="603,196" size="100,100">"Don't tell me you haven't wanted the Pearls restored to the people as much as everyone else," Willem chuckles. "Imagine the look on the faces of the elders in the temple when we bring a truckload of them back!"

"Yeah, I'm sure they'll appreciate it a heap. A hundred Pearls red mean a hundred clams dead," you say fiddling with your fingers.

"Better in our hands than theirs. Or should I say, around our wrists..." he says, guestering to your arm.

You wear a band of small red pearls. They look ordinary, but you have seen first hand their healing power. Not a scar remains from wounds on your body.

Willem leans in. "We'll take better care of the Pearls, and everyone can add another Pearl or two to their bracelets, including - no - //especially// you."

You shuffle in your seat.

[["I'm going to regret this."]]
[["I'm doing this for the village."]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="&quot;I&#39;m going to regret this.&quot;" tags="" position="405,356" size="100,100">"No you're not," Willem says, laughing. "You say that now, but you'll be so proud of what we've achieved afterwards."

You notice his eyes glance every now and again to the Pearls on your wrist. Willem's grandparents were foreigners who had arrived on horseback, poor and looking to trade goods. They were baffled by their reception, which was often scornful or at the least condescending in other towns, and decided to stay in the village.

However, it takes time and generations to earn Pearls for your family. They are not toys to be given out on a whim.

You have a feeling Willem wants to earn a Pearl, one way or another. At least, this seems like a venture beneficial to everyone, not just him.

[["What's the plan?"]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="&quot;I&#39;m doing this for the village.&quot;" tags="" position="598,353" size="100,100">"Of course, and so am I!" Willem says, throwing his hands up.

You don't believe him entirely. 

Willem's grandparents were foreigners who had arrived on horseback, poor and looking to trade goods. They were baffled by their reception, which was often scornful or at the least condescending in other towns, and decided to stay in the village.

However, it takes time and generations to earn Pearls for your family. They are not toys to be given out on a whim.

You have a suspicion he wants to get the Pearls for himself, but you figure the entire village that will gain from the venture, not just Willem.

[["What's the plan?"]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="&quot;What&#39;s the plan?&quot;" tags="" position="501,500" size="100,100">Willem sits back down, leaning forward. He looks determined.

"I have a few different plans. The first one is the least drastic. The last one is the most. Firstly, we could attempt to win the hearts of the flagship's captain. If we can describe the pain the fishing of clams causes the village, and outline an alternative, they might just give it up and hand over the Pearls.

"A little more on the risky side, we could steal the Pearls, which would hopefully in turn create a cashflow crisis and sink the business. Ripple's demise isn't guaranteed but at least we're certain to save the Pearls.

"And, at the extreme end of things, we could go undercover, sabotage the boat and take some Pearls as we escape. There are big up and downsides to this plan though - as it destroys their flagship and those onboard, but also creates a shipwreck at the bottom of the sea. The elders wouldn't be happy about that, no doubt."

You brush your hair through your hands, thinking. The sooner a decision is made, the more comprehensively you can plan.

[[Win over the captain]]

[[Sabotage the flagship]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Steal the Pearls" tags="" position="500,657" size="100,100">(set: $Steal to true)You choose to steal the Pearls from Ripple and Co. You tell Willem and mischief lights up his eyes. He was always a naughty kid, but that was what drew you to him.

"I like it! We'll have to figure out how to get on board, find where they're kept, and transport them discreetly. I think they won't even catch a whiff of us if we're careful."

The thought of being caught makes you nervous, but you remind yourself who this plan is for. All your life you've played by the rules, and so have most of the people in the village, but it hasn't gotten them anywhere. Ripple is exploiting them for it, and it's time to say: "thank you very much for surfacing more Pearls, we'll bring them back to where they belong."

It will be a process though. The two of you will have to be prepared for everything.

[["We're going to need supplies,"]] you point out.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Sabotage the flagship" tags="" position="810,657" size="100,100">(set: $Sabotage to true)You choose to sabotage the flagship. You tell Willem, and it lights a fire of determination in his eyes.

"Go big or go home, that's what I always say," Willem says. "The main challenge is going to be removing the Pearls from the ship unharmed. We could dump them back into the sea, which would at the very least they're back in nature... but it would be even better if we could return them to the village."

You nod your head, but you have your doubts. "I think it will be nearly impossible to take the Pearls off the ship //and// sink it. It's going to take the two of us to simply sabotage it."

Willem nods in solemn thought. "I'll have a think about it," he says finally.

[["We're going to need supplies,"]] you point out.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="&quot;We&#39;re going to need supplies,&quot;" tags="" position="504,851" size="100,100">"Of course," Willem says. "But we don't have much time. Their flagship is due to return from the sea soon with their spoils. It could be any day now. I'll give you until the end of today to get supplies ready for tomorrow. That way, we can begin tomorrow."

You're surprised at the speed Willem plans to go ahead. "Tomorrow? Don't we need more time to figure out how to do this?" you ask.

"Don't worry," Willem says with a wink. "I've planned this out meticulously already. Meet me here by the end of the day."

A man whistles outside a small [[bank-&gt;Bank]] that can fit only a dozen customers inside.

You have run out of time. Although you couldn't grab everything you wanted, you're happy with the items you have collected. They add a bit of weight to your bag, but you are sure they will come in handy.

Behind you people have started a fire in the centre of the Square to drive the bad spirits away. However, it cannot do the same for the flagship still looming in the distance.

You and Willem take a motorboat moored at the docks by the fisherman's hut. The motor spatters at first, but the boat glides along the sea with ease once it starts moving. It is a calm day and the sun warms the deck of the boat.

Ripple and Co's flagship is bigger than you thought it would be. It was easily the size of a warship, and its steel was painted charcoal without a speck of colour in sight. As you grow closer its shape looms above the two of you, and you can see figures watching your approach, rifles in hand. A man leans over the railing and yells.

"Who goes there? What business do you have with our ship?"

You look to Willem. You didn't think of the possibility of being questioned upon arrival. Willem gestures for the man to wait, and digs into his bag to find two fluro vests. He throws you one and puts on the other.

"We're here for the routine maintenance of the ship," Willem answers. The man sizes the pair of you up, and then gives a thumbs up, throwing down a ladder.

Quickly, he finds a trapdoor on the ship. Looking down, the ladder is in disrepair.

(if: $rope is true)[Willem taps you. "Pass us the rope. I'll climb down. Find the captain as soon as you can. You know what to do." You stand there for a second, but you know there's no choice.

Once at the top, a guard immediately confronts you and asks for identification. You tap on each of your pockets and put on a face of exasperation, unable to find any. You take off your bag to start digging around, but the guard stops you with the butt of his gun.

Beside you is a window that has been left open, leading into what appears to be a hallway. Willem looks to you, and you shrug. He pops his head through and then hauls himself inside, landing with a thud.

You follow him, and it is only when you hit the metal floor that you notice the two guards, looking perplexed behind the sights of their rifles. Willem has his hands up, and slowly the guards approach.

"There he is!" you shout. "We were trying to get away from him!"

The guards don't hesitate and bolt down the corridor with their rifles raised. You open your hand and the totem slowly turns to sawdust. The robber was imaginary.

You and Willem jog to a door with //Bridge// written above it. There's a swipe pass that opens it.

"Okay, you know what to do?" Willem asks, and I nod. He gives me a quick pat on the back and then rushes off to work on our escape plan.

You close the door behind you and sit down the other end of the table. (if: $oranges is true)[You then open the bag of oranges and roll each orange up the table, one by one. This gets the captain's attention.

"I warn you, it's not just me onboard this ship sticking explosives in every corner. We are highly organised and prepared to sink this ship if you don't do what we say," you warn.

"How do I know you're telling the truth?" he says. "You could easily be on your own and I wouldn't know the better."

There's some nerve on this captain. He's still challenging you like you are another crew member. Still, you are determined to get what you want, even if it means simply destroying the ship. If Willem was here, he would be angry.

"Ah, yes I know the one," he says. He doesn't sound overly concerned.

"Yes. Now, I'll be honest with you. My village is extremely concerned about the state of the sea and its clams. Clam fishing is an ancient practice here, but recently we've noticed there's few left, and soon they will be gone. We think it would be in your best interest to cease fishing in this sea, and otherwise the responsible course of action to help preserve our culture.

The captain is quiet for a moment, and then chuckles. "If you think I have any agency over Ripple's fishing... you would be very wrong my friend."

"Of course," you reply, keeping to the script you have in your head. "I have a friend that lives in the village South of here, and only recently it came to my attention that they value this sea's Pearls there as sacred and part of their identities. As a result, I have considered the impact Ripple has on the village and decided to sell my shares unless Ripple shifts their focus away from the sea's clams."

Willem takes the opportunity to grab your arm and go, staying quiet while the man starts counting the money. Towards the centre of the ship, there's a stairwell with a sign: //To the Bridge//. You try the handle. It's locked. (if: $rope is true)[Then, you remember the rope.
